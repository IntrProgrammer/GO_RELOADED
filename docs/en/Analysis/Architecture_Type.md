The type that i choose to implement solving GO_RELOADED was FSM 


Why FSM over Pipeline approach

The reason i chose FSM over Pipeline is 
    1.Better controll of the flow when you can go back and forth as many time 
        as fetted from to state until you have your desired outcome 
    2.Faster for small size files no piping to function means no overhead 
        just the main functionallity like a complete machine 
        Like a (system on a chip)soc.
